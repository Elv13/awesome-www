One year after the first version of awesome ever released,
the final release of the 3.0 version is out.
To download it, see the [[download]] page.

This is the brand new major release of awesome, deprecating the 2.x branch
definitively.

We thanks all contributors and users we had on this.

Don't hesitate to report bugs and ask or write enhancements on [awesome BTS](/bugs/).

Have fun and be awesome, as always!
