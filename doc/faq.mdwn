#awesome frequently asked questions.

## I found a bug, what I do?

First, test the developement version to check if it's still here.
If the bug is a behaviour not expected, please explain what you expected.
If the bug is a segmentation fault, please include a full backtrace (use gdb).

In any case, please try to explain how to reproduce it.

## Do you accept patches, enhancements?

Yes, I do. Please send them to me or the mailing-list for review. See also the [devel](/devel/) section.

## I'd like to contribute to awesome Web site, how can I do?

Please grab sources via git [here](http://git.naquadah.org/?p=awesome-www.git;a=summary).
You can grab them using git, or you can generate a tarball from the Web interface.
Then, send patches to awesome list, or to me.

## I used to pipe things to be printed in stdin (like dwm) in awesome 1.x, it does not work in awesome 2.0, why?

Because we implemented a better system. You want to use awesome-client which read the following from stdin:
 #screen uicb arg

So to change the statusbar text on screen 0, simply do the following:
> echo 0 setstatustext "Hello, awesome world!" | awesome-client

If you want to view another tag on screen 1:
> echo 1 tag_view 3 | awesome-client

etc.
